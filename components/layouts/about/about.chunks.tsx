            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              CatBreeds was founded by a team of cat enthusiasts who recognized the need for a comprehensive,
              user-friendly platform dedicated to cat breed information. We noticed that while there was plenty of
              information scattered across the internet, there wasn&#39;t a single, reliable source that combined detailed
              breed data with an engaging user experience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Our team consists of web developers, cat behaviorists, veterinarians, and passionate cat owners who work
              together to ensure that every piece of information on our platform is accurate, helpful, and presented in
              an accessible way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We&#39;re constantly working to improve our platform, adding new features and expanding our breed database to
              serve the global community of cat lovers better.
